    <p>Gather chicken ingredients. Place the boneless chicken tenderloins in an airtight container and add Greek seasoning, olive oil and lemon juice. Let the chicken marinate for at least 30 minutes and up to 48 hours. Gather remaining ingredients and pre heat grill to medium high. Remove chicken from marinade and grill until the center is no longer pink and the exterior is golden brown. Remove from heat and set aside. Place a piece of tinfoil on your countertop. Add the warmed pita to the middle of the tinfoil and top with chopped lettuce, tzatziki sauce, chicken tenders, tomato, red onion, and dill. Gently lift the sides of the pita up to create a taco-like shape to your chicken gyro. Pull the tinfoil tight around the sandwich (to help keeps it shape) and serve. </p>
